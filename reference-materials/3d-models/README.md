# 3D Models

Due to Github size limitations, only a few models have been included. Please visit the [HiWonder Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nhIcEQajz43LKeNfW1bdk_ILzTJVsNxy?usp=drive_link) for all assets.

I highly recommend using [3DViewer.net](https://3dviewer.net/), it's free, but there may be better alternatives.

Including additional models I found from @quikenb on Github [6DoF-HiWonder-LeArm/CAD-Files](https://github.com/6DoF-HiWonder-LeArm/CAD-Files). These are the Solidworks CAD files for the HiWonder Learm released under the a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.
